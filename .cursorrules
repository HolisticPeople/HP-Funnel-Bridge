# HP-Funnel-Bridge - NOT for Funnel Creation

## WARNING: This plugin is NOT for creating new funnels

HP-Funnel-Bridge connects the external Lovable/React funnel (illumodine-boost-funnel) to WordPress. 

**DO NOT use this plugin when asked to create new funnels.**

## For Funnel Creation, Use HP-React-Widgets

The correct system for creating new funnels is the **HP-React-Widgets AI Funnel API**:

### API Base
```
/wp-json/hp-rw/v1/ai/
```

### Key Endpoints
- `GET /ai/system/explain` - System documentation
- `GET /ai/schema` - Schema with AI hints
- `POST /ai/funnels` - Create funnel
- `POST /ai/protocols/build-kit` - Build kit from protocol

### Documentation
See `HP-React-Widgets/docs/AI_FUNNEL_CREATION.md` for complete guide.

### MCP Access
Use `woocommerce_mcp_staging` or `woocommerce_mcp_production` MCP servers.

## What HP-Funnel-Bridge IS For

This plugin provides:
1. REST API bridge between Lovable React app and WordPress/WooCommerce
2. Configuration for the external satellite funnel
3. Checkout processing for the Lovable funnel

It does NOT create new funnels - it only bridges an existing external funnel.
